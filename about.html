    <h2>Software Engineer, Math Student, Swing Dancer &amp; DJ</h2>
    <h3>who wants to make a difference.</h3>
    <hr class="light" />
    <p>
      I am a software engineer on the Community Platform Engineering team at
      Red Hat, Inc., who lives in northeastern Ohio. My research interests
      include programming language theory, type theory, category theory, and
      logic. I want to work hard to <strong>better the state of the software
      engineering industry</strong> by making use of these fields.

  <h2>My <strong>Life Summary</strong></h2>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>Computers</h3>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer on the Fedora Engineering team at Red Hat, Inc.
        In my spare time, I research type systems and programming language
        theory. I maintain a plethora of open source projects, and nearly
        everything I touch is open source.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        I am learning upright bass and hope to one day be a jazz
        bassist. Alongside this, I have been known to fiddle around on my
        electric drum set, upright piano, bass guitar, and acoustic guitar.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>Dance</h3>
      <p>
        I am a swing and blues dancer who also DJs dances in the Pittsburgh and
        Northeast Ohio areas. My DJ set-lists are available by clicking the link
        at the top of the page. I also run sound for live-band dances in
        Pittsburgh.

  <h2><strong>Areas</strong> of Interest</h2>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Research Interests</h3>
      <p>
        I love learning about ways of improving and advancing computer science and
        software engineering. I spend a large amount of my time reading about
        <strong>type theory</strong>, <strong>category theory</strong>,
        and <strong>logic</strong>, along with applications of all of these, such
        as <strong>Idris</strong>, <strong>PureScript</strong>,
        <strong>Haskell</strong>, and <strong>Coq</strong>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Spare-time Interests</h3>
      <p>
        When I'm not contributing to Open Source Software or reading about my
        research interests, I am usually <strong>taking pictures</strong>,
        playing <strong>chess</strong>, talking on the
        <strong>ham radio</strong> bands, or playing with my
        <strong>german shephard dog</strong>, Skye. Or, of course, doing homework.
        I have also recently taken a strong interest in linguistics, so you might
        find me hiding behind an open Linguistics book, or studying a language such
        as Latin or Spanish. In the future, I hope to learn about categorial
        linguistics -- applying type theory and category theory to linguistics. In
        addition to the above, I love <strong>swing and blues dancing</strong>.

  <h2>Leadership and Achievements</h2>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>
        I've held several leadership positions during my time as a university
        student, including presidential and vice-presidential positions for
        several clubs. I am the president of the Northeast Ohio Experimenters
        Club.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Achievements</h3>
      <p>
        In 2004, I passed my amateur radio exam and became an amateur radio
        operator. In 2012, I passed the next test and became a general-class
        amateur radio operator. In 2014, I became an ARRL-accredited Volunteer
        Examiner. In 2017, I finally obtained my extra-class license.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2012, I was awarded the Fedora Scholarship because of my involvement
        within the Fedora Community. In 2011, I was awarded a scholarship by the
        ARRL for my involvement in the hobby of amateur radio.

  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I took a serious interest in programming in 2005 and in 2012 I realized for
        the first time how much room there is for improvement in our field. This
        discovery led me to statically typed functional programming which further
        led me to category theory and my other research interests, which are listed
        above.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience with Haskell, Idris, Coq, Scala, Fay, and PureScript,
        along with imperative and object-oriented languages such as Python, Ruby,
        and Java.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>System Administration Experience</h3>
      <p>
        During high school, I was enrolled in a Cisco networking class where I
        received college credits and learned about routing and networking. Around
        the time I graduated high school, I joined the Fedora Project's
        infrastructure team and have been a part of it ever since. I help to
        maintain a large number of applications and servers. In early 2014, I also
        joined the haskell.org infrastructure team where I help to maintain the
        servers and applications used there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience with various Linux environments including Fedora, RHEL,
        CentOS, Gentoo, NixOS, ArchLinux, Debian, and Ubuntu. I have a working
        knowledge of FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am familiar with several configuration management systems, including
        Puppet, Ansible, and Chef. I have an interest in cryptography and security
        and applying these to infrastructures.
