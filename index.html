  <h2>Computer Science and Mathematics Student</h2>
  <h3>who wants to make a difference.</h3>
  <hr class="light" />
  <p>
    I am a student who is dual-majoring in <strong>computer science</strong> and
    <strong>mathematics</strong> at Youngstown State University. I live in Ohio
    and hold a remote position at Red Hat, Inc. where I work on the Fedora
    Engineering team. My research interests include programming language theory,
    type theory, category theory, and logic. I want to work hard to
    <strong>better the state of the software engineering industry.</strong>

  <h3>Research Interests</h3>
  <p>
    I love learning about ways of improving and advancing computer science and
    software engineering. I spend a large amount of my time reading about
    <strong>type theory</strong>, <strong>category theory</strong>,
    and <strong>logic</strong>, along with applications of all of these, such
    as <strong>Idris</strong>, <strong>PureScript</strong>, and
    <strong>Haskell</strong>.

  <h3>Spare-time Interests</h3>
  <p>
    When I'm not contributing to Open Source Software or reading about my
    research interests, I am usually <strong>taking pictures</strong>,
    reading about <strong>typography</strong>, talking on the
    <strong>ham radio</strong> bands, or playing with my
    <strong>german shephard dog</strong>, Skye.

  <h3>Leadership</h3>
  <p>
    I am the former vice president of the Youngstown State University's
    Student Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the
    University of Akron's Amateur Radio Club.

  <h3>Achievements</h3>
  <p>
    In 2004, I passed my amateur radio exam and became an amateur radio
    operator. In 2012, I passed the next test and became a general-class
    amateur radio operator.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2012, I was awarded the Fedora Scholarship because of my involvement
    within the Fedora Community. In 2011, I was awarded a scholarship by the
    ARRL for my involvement in the hobby of amateur radio.

  <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
  <p>
    I took a serious interest in programming in 2006 and in 2012 I realized for
    the first time how much room there is for improvement in our field. This
    discovery led me to statically typed functional programming which further
    led me to category theory and my other research interests, which are listed
    above.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have experience with Haskell, Idris, Scala, Fay, and PureScript, along
    with languages more commonly used in industry, such as Python, Ruby, and
    Java. I also have experience with various Linux environments including
    Fedora, RHEL, NixOS, ArchLinux, Debian, and Ubuntu.

  <h3>System Administration Experience</h3>
  <p>
    During high school, I was enrolled in a Cisco networking class where I
    received college credits and learned about routing and networking. Around
    the time I graduated high school, I joined the Fedora Project's
    infrastructure team and have been a part of it ever since. I help to
    maintain a large number of applications and servers. In early 2014, I also
    joined the haskell.org infrastructure team where I help to maintain the
    servers and applications used there.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have experience with several configuration management systems, including
    Puppet, Ansible, and Chef. I am experimenting with NixOps for NixOS as of
    this writing. I have an interesst in cryptography and security and applying
    these to infrastructures.
