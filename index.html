    <div class="col-lg-9">
      <p>
        I am a <strong>computer science student</strong> who is currently
        attending <strong>Youngstown State University</strong>, in Youngstown,
        Ohio. I am also employeed at <strong>Red Hat, Inc.</strong> where I work
        on the <strong>Fedora Engineering</strong> team. I enjoy programming
        language theory (PLT) research (especially functional programming),
        photography, calligraphy, chess, logic, and abstract mathematics.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
      <p>
        I am very active within the <strong>open source community</strong>. I tend
        to work on projects in a variety of programming languages, although I have
        found that the use of functional programming leads to more productivity
        than other paradigms. Because of this, I love working with languages
        which permit functional programming to a large extent. Examples of such
        languages include <strong>Haskell</strong>, <strong>Idris</strong>, and
        <strong>Agda</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my projects include the <a href="http://eval.so/">eval.so</a>
        code evaluation API,
        <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/mobile">Fedora Mobile</a>,
        and a
        <a href="https://github.com/CodeBlock/bing_translator-gem">Ruby Gem</a>
        that I wrote several years ago which allows for easy access to the Bing
        translation API.
      </p>
      <p>
        These projects are all on GitHub. Some of them are on my
        <a href="https://github.com/codeblock/"> personal</a> GitHub profile,
        while others are part of organizations on GitHub, of which I am a member.

      <h3>Research, Education, Learning</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
      <p>
        I graduated <strong>Barberton High School</strong> in 2010, and am
        currently enrolled at Youngstown State University where I am majoring
        in Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning, especially when it relates to programming language
        theory and/or mathematics. I've recently begun studying
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">Category
          Theory</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Theory">Type Theory</a>.
        Along with the above, I've also taken a strong liking to
        functional programming, which has taught me more about writing correct and
        working programs than I ever knew before.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am the vice president for the Youngstown State University's student
        <a href="http://ysu.acm.org/">ACM chapter</a>, along with being a
        long-time member of the University of Akron's amateur radio club,
        W8UPD, despite no longer attending the University of Akron.

      <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
      <p>
        I began programming when I was a freshman in high school. I started with
        Perl before moving on to PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java. Nowadays I prefer to
        use languages which permit functional programming to a great extent.
        Examples of such languages are listed above, in the "Projects" section.

      <h3>Awards and Achievements</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
      <p>
        I passed my amateur radio "technician" class exam in 2004, at the age of
        13. I have since upgraded to the "general" class, in 2012. I hold the
        vanity callsign "N8SQL."
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2012, I was awarded the Fedora Scholarship because of my involvement
        within the Fedora Community. In 2011, I was awarded a scholarship by the
        ARRL for my involvement in the hobby of amateur radio.

      <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
      <p>
        I enjoy fiddling with electronics and making them do neat things. In my
        (lack of) spare time, I enjoy photography. I shoot a Pentax K-30
        I still get on the ham radio bands occasionally, and
        particularly enjoy making contacts along with the local club on Field
        Day. A newly discovered hobby of mine is playing chess. I try to do some
        tactics puzzles every day to raise my ELO.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a student member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
        and enjoy reading papers from their library, as well as jouranls about
        category theory and programming language theory.
